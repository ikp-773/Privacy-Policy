# Privacy-Policy

## **I. Introduction**
When you use Xplor, you trust us with your personal data. We’re committed to keeping that trust. That starts with helping you understand our privacy practices.

This notice describes the personal data we collect, how it’s used and shared, and your choices regarding this data. We recommend that you read this along with our [privacy overview](https://www.uber.com/privacy/overview), which highlights key points about our privacy practices.
## **II. Overview**
### **A. Scope**

This notice applies to users of Xplor’s services anywhere in the world, including users of Xplor’s apps, websites, features, or other services. This notice describes how Xplor and its affiliates collect and use personal data. This notice applies to all users of our apps, websites, features, or other services anywhere in the world, unless covered by a separate privacy notice. This notice specifically applies to:

- **Drivers:** individuals who provide transportation to passengers individually or through partner transportation companies
- **Passengers:** individuals who use transportation service for commute via Xplor

This notice also governs Xplor’s other collections of personal data in connection with its services. For example, we may collect the contact information of individuals who use accounts owned by Xplor for Business customers, or of owners or employees of restaurants or other merchants; personal data of those who start but do not complete applications to be drivers or passengers persons; or other personal data in connection with our mapping technology and features.

All those subject to this notice are referred to as “users” in this notice.Our practices are subject to applicable laws in the places in which we operate. This means that we engage in the practices described in this notice in a particular country or region only if permitted under the laws of those places. Please contact us through the addresses below with any questions regarding our practices in a particular country or region.

Xplor operates, and processes personal data, globally. We may also transfer such data to countries other than the one where our users live or use Xplor’s services. We do so in order to fulfill our agreements with users, such as our Terms of Use, or based on users’ prior consent, adequacy decisions for the relevant countries, or other transfer mechanisms as may be available under applicable law.

Questions, comments, and complaints about Xplor’s data practices can be submitted to the given address.
## **III. Data collections and uses**
### **A. The data we collect**

Xplor collects personal data: 

- provided by users to Xplor, such as during account creation
- created during use of our services, such as location, app usage, and device data

from other sources, such as other users or account owners, business partners, vendors, insurance and financial solution providers, and governmental authorities

The following personal data is collected by or on behalf of Xplor:

**1. Data provided by users.** This includes:

- **User profile:** We collect data when users create or update their Xplor accounts. This may include their name, email, phone number, login name and password, address, profile picture, payment or banking information (including related payment verification information), driver’s license and other government identification documents (which may indicate document numbers as well as birth date, gender, and photo). This also includes vehicle or insurance information of drivers, emergency contact information, user settings using Xplor app.

  We may use the photos submitted by users to verify their identities, such as through facial verification technologies. For more information, please see the section titled “**How we use personal data**.”
- **Background check and identity verification (drivers )**. This may include information such as driver history or criminal record (where permitted by law), license status, known aliases and prior addresses, and right to work. This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on Xplor’s behalf. We also verify the identities of drivers.
- **Demographic data:** We may collect demographic data about users, including through user surveys. In some countries, we may also receive demographic data about users from third parties.

  We may also infer demographic data from other data collected from users. For example, where necessary to enable features that allow women to provide or receive services from other women, we may infer gender using their first name. In such cases, we enable users to change their gender if necessary via in-app settings.
- **User content:** We collect the data submitted by users when they contact Xplor customer support.
- **Travel information:** We collect travel itinerary information, including the times and dates of upcoming flight, lodging or car rental reservations, from users of our Xplor Travel feature. We collect such information: (i) when users manually input their information into an Xplor Travel itinerary; or (2) if authorized by users to access their Gmail accounts, from traveled-related email confirmations. If so authorized, Xplor will only access users’ Gmail accounts to collect travel itinerary information to enable the Xplor Travel feature, and will adhere to [Google’s API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the limitations on use of data collected from users’ Gmail accounts.

**2. Data created during use of our services.** This includes: 

- **Location data :** We collect precise or approximate location data, including to enable rides and deliveries, to enable tracking and safety features, to prevent and detect fraud, and to satisfy legal requirements. Xplor collects this data when the Xplor app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen) of their mobile device.

- Drivers and passengers may use the Xplor apps without enabling Xplor to collect precise location data from their mobile devices. However, this may affect features in the Xplor apps. For example, a user who has not enabled location data collection will have to manually enter their pick-up address. In addition, the location data collected from a driver during a trip will be linked to the driver’s account, even if the driver has not enabled location data to be collected from their device, including for purposes of receipt generation, customer support, fraud detection, insurance, and litigation.
- **Transaction information:** We collect transaction information related to the use of our services, including the type of services requested or provided, order details, payment transaction information, passengers information, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and payment method. Additionally, if someone uses your promotion code, we may associate your name with that person.
- **Usage data:** We collect data about how users interact with our services. This includes data such as access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, and type of browser. We may also collect data regarding the third-party sites or services used before interacting with our services, which we use for marketing. (Please see "**How We Use Data**" below for more information on how we market our services to users).

  In some cases, we collect this data through cookies, pixels, tags, and similar tracking technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. To learn more about these technologies, please see our [Cookie Notice](https://www.uber.com/legal/privacy/cookies). 
- **Device data:** We may collect data about the devices used to access our services, including the hardware models, device IP address or other unique device identifiers, operating systems and versions, software, preferred languages, advertising identifiers, device motion data, and mobile network data.
- **Communications data:** We enable users to communicate with each other and Xplor through Xplor’s mobile apps and websites. For example, we enable drivers and drivers, and passengers persons and passengers recipients, to call, text, or send other files to each other (generally without disclosing their telephone numbers to each other). To provide this service, Xplor receives some data regarding the calls, texts, or other communications, including the date and time of the communications and the content of the communications. Xplor may also use this data for customer support services (including to resolve disputes between users), for safety and security purposes, to improve our services and features, and for analytics.
- **Safety recordings**: In certain jurisdictions, and where permitted by law, users can record the audio and/or video of their trips through an in-app feature.  In app recordings are encrypted and stored on users’ devices, and are only shared with Xplor if submitted to customer support by the users in connection with safety incidents. 

**3. Data from other sources.** These include:

- Users participating in our referral programs. For example, when a user refers to another person, we receive the referred person’s personal data from that user.
- Xplor account owners who request services for or on behalf of other users, or who enable such users to request or receive services through their accounts. This includes owners of Xplor for Business accounts.
- users or others providing information in connection with claims or disputes.

- vendors who help us verify users’ identity, background information, and eligibility to work, or who screen users in connection with sanctions, anti-money laundering, or know-your-customer requirements 
- insurance, vehicle, or financial services providers for drivers and/or passengers persons
- partner transportation companies (for drivers or passengers persons who use our services through an account associated with such a company)
- publicly available sources
- marketing service providers or data resellers whose data Xplor uses for marketing or research
- law enforcement officials, public health officials, and other government authorities

**1. To provide our services.** Xplor uses data to provide, personalize, maintain, and improve our services.

This includes using data to:

- create/update accounts

**2. Safety and security.** We use personal data to help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our services and users. This includes:

- verifying users' identity and eligibility to provide transportation or deliveries, including through reviews of background checks, where permitted by law, to help prevent use of our services by unsafe drivers and/or drivers. Where permitted by law, this also includes performing facial verification of photographs submitted by users, or collected from public databases, to prevent identity-borrowing or to verify users’ identities.
- using data from drivers’ or passengers persons’ devices to detect unsafe driving behavior such as speeding or harsh braking and acceleration, and to inform them of safer driving practices. We also use data from passengers persons’ devices to verify the type of vehicles they used to provide deliveries.
- using device, location, user profile, usage, and other data to prevent, detect, and combat fraud. This includes identifying fraudulent accounts or uses of our services, preventing use of our services by unauthorized drivers or passengers persons, verifying user identities in connection with certain payment methods, and preventing and combating unauthorized access to users’ accounts.
- using user ratings, reported incidents, and other feedback to encourage compliance with our [Community Guidelines](https://www.uber.com/legal/community-guidelines/us-en/) and as grounds for deactivating users with low ratings or who otherwise violated such guidelines in certain countries.
- sharing information regarding serious driver or passengers person safety incidents or compliance with local regulations with third parties, including other companies who enable users to request or provide rides or passengers services, or intermediaries who collect and report such information for multiple companies, to prevent drivers or passengers persons who may pose a safety risk to the platform or its users from using Xplor’s or those other companies’ services. We may also share with third parties, including those affected by such incidents, whether the incidents result in account deactivation.
- using ratings, usage and other data to prevent matching of drivers and drivers for whom there is higher risk of conflict (for instance, because one user previously gave the other a one-star rating).

Xplor performs the above activities on the grounds that they are necessary to fulfill our obligations to users under our Terms of Use or other agreements with users, and/or for purposes of the legitimate safety and security interests of Xplor or other parties, including users and members of the general public.

Xplor performs the above activities on the grounds that they are necessary to fulfill our obligations to users under our Terms of Use or other agreements with users.

**6. Marketing.** Xplor may use personal data to market our services to our users. This includes sending users communications about Xplor services, features, promotions, sweepstakes, studies, surveys, news, updates, and events. We may do so through various methods, including email, text messages, push notifications, in app communications and ads, and ads on third party platforms.

We may also inform users about products and services offered by Xplor partners. For example, we may provide recommendations, promotions, or ads for Xplor partners based on users’ past passengers orders. Although we inform users about products and services offered by Xplor partners, **we do not sell users’ personal data to, or share it with, such partners or others for purposes of their own direct marketing or advertising, except with users’ consent.**

We may use the data we collect, including in combination with advertising partners’ data, to personalize and improve the marketing communications (including ads) that we send on and off Xplor’s apps and websites, including based on user location, use of Xplor’s services, and user preferences and settings. For example, we share user data (such as hashed email address, usage information, and device or user identifiers) with Facebook and TikTok to personalize and improve our ads for Xplor’s services.

For information about how to opt out of certain marketing communications (including ads) from Xplor and its advertising partners, please see the section titled “**Marketing choices**.”

- matching available drivers and passengers persons to users requesting services. Users can be matched based on availability, proximity, and other factors such as likelihood to accept a trip based on their past behavior or preferences. 
- flagging users who are identified as having engaged in fraud, unsafe activity, or other activities that may harm Xplor, its users, and others. In some cases, such as when a user is determined to be abusing Xplor’s referral program or has submitted fraudulent documents, such behavior may result in automatic deactivation.
- using driver location information, and communications between drivers and drivers, to identify cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud. 
- Using driver data (such as location, rating and gender) and driver data (such as rating, origin and destination) to help avoid pairings of users that may result in increased risk of conflict.

Xplor retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above.

- Users may request deletion of their accounts at any time. Xplor may retain user data after a deletion request due to legal or regulatory requirements or for reasons stated in this policy.

Xplor retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above. This means that we retain different categories of data for different periods of time depending on the type of data, the category of user to whom the data relates, and the purposes for which we collected the data.

Users may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings > Privacy menus in the Xplor app, or through Xplor’s website (drivers and passengers recipients [here](https://help.uber.com/h/24010fe7-7a67-4ee5-9938-c734000b144a); drivers and passengers persons [here](https://help.uber.com/h/55ae2bb5-b102-4ab0-9ed3-32f4db95f0e5)).

- Following an account deletion request, Xplor deletes the user’s account and data, unless they must be retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute. Because we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements relating to drivers and passengers persons, this generally means that we retain their account and data for a minimum of 7 years after a deletion request. For drivers and passengers recipients, their data is generally deleted within 90 days of a deletion request, except where retention is necessary for the above reasons.

IV. Choice and transparency

Xplor enables users to access and/or control data that Xplor collects, including through: 

- privacy settings

**2. Device permissions**

Most mobile device platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without the device owner’s permission, and these platforms have different methods for how that permission can be obtained. Please check the available settings on your device or check with your provider.

**3. In-app ratings pages**

After every trip, drivers and drivers are able to rate each other on a scale from 1 to 5. An average of those ratings is associated with a user’s account and is displayed to other users for whom they provide or receive services. For example, driver ratings are available to drivers from whom they request transportation, and driver ratings are available to their drivers.

This 2-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior. Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for drivers and drivers.

drivers can see their average rating in the main menu of the Xplor app.

Drivers can see their average rating after tapping their profile photo in the Xplor Driver app.

passengers persons may also be rated by passengers recipients, restaurants and merchants. 

**4. Marketing choices**

Users may opt out of certain marketing communications (including ads) and use of their data for marketing in the following ways:
